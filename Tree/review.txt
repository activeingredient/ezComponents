Review Alexandru 14-09-2007
---------------------------

[ ] Failed test: testTreeFetchSubtreeDepthFirst in ezcTreeDbMaterializedPathTest
    with MySQL, because of MySQL sorting.

[ ] Oracle tests fail in TreeDatabaseTiein and TreePersistentObjectTiein:
    'PDOException: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 942 OCIStmtExecute:
    ORA-00942: table or view does not exist'.

[X] XHTML visitor: the hightlight class applies to the whole subtree - is it correct?

    It was, but I added an option to make both subtrees and just nodes
    highlighted now.

[X] Files missing __get() and __set() ($this->properties is accessed directly):
     - Tree/src/backends/memory.php
     - Tree/src/backends/xml.php (__get() is present, but not fully implemented)
     - Tree/src/tree_node.php (__get() and set() are implemented but not used)
     - Tree/src/tree.php (__get() and __set() are implemented but not used)
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_materialized_path.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_nested_set.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_parent_child.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db.php

[X] Files missing __isset():
     - Tree/src/backends/memory.php
     - Tree/src/backends/xml.php
     - Tree/src/tree_node.php
     - Tree/src/tree.php
     - Tree/src/tree_node_list.php (probably not needed here)
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_materialized_path.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_nested_set.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db_parent_child.php
     - TreeDatabaseTiein/src/backends/db.php

    ezcTreeNodeList did indeed not need it (because of ArrayAccess), and all
    the backends actually inherit ezcTree, which does now implement __isset().

[X] Files missing __set_state():
     - Tree/src/structs/memory_node.php
     - Tree/src/structs/transaction_item.php

    They are not public, so they don't need __set_state(). I marked them as
    private classes now.


Other points
------------

[X] Issue #11444: Allow the / char to be changed in the materialized path
    implementation, and add a check for this char in used IDs when creating a
    new node.

[ ] Check how we can use node names paths to retrieve items.

[X] Check XHTML visitor's generation of paths - they are sort of useles as only the
    last item is used. Perhaps make this an option.

[X] Check if the highlighting can be done on the data, and not the <li> nodes -
    make that an option as well perhaps.

[ ] Check example from Alex, and add them to docs if useful.
