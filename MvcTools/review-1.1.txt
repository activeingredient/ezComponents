Review of MvcTools-1.1-alpha at 02.06.09
========================================

:Author: ts

Issues
------

[ ] ezcMvcNoNamedRouteException is not a really clear name. I'd suggest
    ezcMvcNamedRouteNotFoundException.

[ ] File name "named_route_no_reversable.php" should be
    "named_route_not_reversable.php" (no -> not).

[ ] MvcTools/src/routes/rails.php +171: Why is the reference operator used
    here (and in some other foreach loops)?

[ ] ezcMvcReversedRoute is not a good name. Should be ezcMvcInvertibleRoute.

[ ] MvcTools/src/interfaces/controller.php +122: "isset(
    $this->properties['router'] )" since when did we change this? Did we use
	to return true on any existing property, no matter if null?

[ ] MvcTools/src/interfaces/controller.php: What if a request variable is
    named 'router'?

[ ] Enhancement #14740: "Make overriding the pattern to match in routes
    easier". Is the "." syntax the ruby way of doing this? What about routing
	per HTTP method?

[ ] Doc issues via docanalysis too.

Enhancements
------------

- There should be the possibility to expose reverse route generation through a
  template function in MvcTemplateTiein
