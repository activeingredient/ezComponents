Review of MvcTools-1.0-alpha at 26.11.08
========================================

:Author: kn

.. warning::
    Work in progress.

API
---

- The abstract class ezcMvcRouter contains a methods, which I do not really
  get:

  - The static public method prefix() is not used ore referenced anywhere
    else in that class

- If createFatalRedirectRequest() is not implemented properly in
  ezcMvcDispatcherConfiguration, the thrown error is not very intuitive::

    Recoverable error: Argument 1 passed to
    arbitDispatcherConfiguration::runPreRoutingFilters() must be an instance
    of ezcMvcRequest, null given

  Changing this would of course mean another check, but this should only
  happen in errneous situations anyways...

Documentation
-------------

- Didn't we agree to document parameters in teh method description and not
  behind the parameter, like in MvcTools/src/interfaces/route.php +25?

- The purpose behind ezcMvcRoute::prefix() is not obvious to me from the
  documentation.

  And I don't think the prefixing fixes all the issues, which occur regarding
  prefixes of controller paths (application in subdirectory, running a PHAR,
  using mod_rewrite, ..)

- The documentation in ezcMvcHttpRequestParser is incomplete.

Trivial, maybe irrelevant
-------------------------

ezcMvcConfigurableDispatcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Increase $redirects at begin of loop, reduces redundancy and makes it less
  error proone if somebody extends / changes the code.

- Even 25 should be save, make the maximum internal redirects configurable?
