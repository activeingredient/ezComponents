====================
Document conversions
====================

This document aims to document a list of semantic markup elements, which can
not be converted into one or another markup language, so you have to expect
loss in the sematic document information during conversions.

Sourse RST
==========

Conversion loss, when the source is a RST document.

Docbook
-------

- Strong emphasis

  There is no strong emphasis markup in Docbook, so we use <emphasis
  role="strong"/> for this, while the role may be lost during further
  conversions.

- Table colspan

  Table colspan are available in Docbook, but the markup is rather unintuitive
  and hard to read. These information may be lost during further conversions.

- Footnote enumeration

  In docbook footnote do not have any user assigned enumeration, while in RST
  there may be multiple footnotes with the same (labeled) user assigned
  number. This information is completely lost during conversion.

- Substitutions
  
  The substitution references are not preserved, but just substituted during
  the conversion process. The information about the parts which were
  substituted is completely lost.

- Line blocks / lietaral blocks
 
  Line blocks and literal blocks are converted to <literalblock> elements,
  only diffing by the given class attribute.

XHTML
-----

- Headers
 
  XHtml only allows a specification of header levels from 1 to 6. All headers
  with a depth of â‰¥ 6 contain a class attribute specifying their real depth.
