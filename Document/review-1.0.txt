[ ] Shouldn't the ezcDocumentRstXhtmlVisitorTests tests just be
    ezcDocumentXhtmlVisitorTests ?

[ ] Low code coverage in some parts.

[ ] There are some @TODOs in the code.

[ ] Why is ezcDocumentManager final?

[ ] Why are the option class names including "Base" as in
    ezcDocumentParserBaseOptions and ezcDocumentConverterBaseOptions,
    ezcDocumentXmlBaseOptions.

[ ] A description of how the RST parser actually works should be added.

[ ] Some of the class descriptions in document/rst/nodes/* are incorrect
    (Example is ezcDocumentRstSubstitutionNode).

[ ] ezcDocumentRstToken doesn't have the constants documented - also run
    the doc analysis tool because there's some other stuff as well.

[ ] WHy is the RstXhtmlVisitor not simple a docbook visitor to generate XHTML?

[ ] The tutorial should mention on how to extend the RST directives thingy.
