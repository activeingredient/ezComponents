Review Alexandru 05-11-2008
---------------------------

[ ] Wrong headers in some files ("File containing the XXX class", "Base class...").

[ ] Wrong package names (Table, PageBreak, etc) (see issue #13829).

[ ] rst2xhtml conversion does not work for all ezc tutorials (some
    elements are not supported, like replace).

[ ] Linux-style path separator used in some files.

[ ] Some functions which return bool are documented with '@return void'.

- Some typos in the code and comments:

[ ] /src/exceptions/errnous_xml.php
    Errnous -> Erroneous

[ ] /src/document/xml/xhtml/filter/element/base.php
    boolena -> bool
