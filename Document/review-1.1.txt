Review Alexandru 05-11-2008
---------------------------

[ ] Wrong headers in some files ("File containing the XXX class", "Base class...").

[ ] Wrong package names (Table, PageBreak, etc) (see issue #13829).

[ ] rst2xhtml conversion does not work for all ezc tutorials (some
    elements are not supported, like replace).

[ ] Linux-style path separator used in some files.

[ ] Some functions which return bool are documented with '@return void'.

- Some typos in the code and comments:

[ ] /src/exceptions/errnous_xml.php
    Errnous -> Erroneous

[ ] /src/document/xml/xhtml/filter/element/base.php
    boolena -> bool

----------------------

[ ] Missing tutorial for new formats.

[ ] Wierd @apichange tag in Document/src/options/document_rst.php.

[ ] I'd suggest to have a wrapper class for each Wiki format, to allow
    creation of Wiki documents in the same way as for other documents. For
	example ezcDocumentWikiCreole to create a wiki document with the creole
	tokenizer.

[ ] It sounds like a good idea to register a default directive for all
    directives mentioned in the RST specification. Otherwise people get an
	error, if the try to convert documents containing such directives.
