[x] ezcDebug::getStackTrace() is not documented.
[x] ezcDebugException: component level exceptions should always be abstract,
    and thus there needs to be a new more specific exceptions. (See
    http://ezcomponents.org/contributing/coding_standards#exceptions)
[ ] The example stylesheet misses classes for the stack trace CSS classes.
[x] ezcDebugStacktraceIterator::__construct() should really be the first method
    in the class.
[x] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool has the constants undocumented.
[x] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool::getPropertyVisibility uses expressions in in the
    case statement, that's quite confusing to read. I prefer the use of
    "if/else" here.
[ ] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool::getPropertyValue - there is a TODO, can you check
    that for PHP 5.2.1 and up?
[x] The ezcDebug class docs don't mention anything about the options, so how do
    I know where to set them? It's because the properties of the class are not
    documented, but the class doc block itself should mention it additionally
    as well.
[ ] The variable output in stack traces should be configurable, like Xdebug.
    There is way too much output by default now making them quite useless.
[ ] The tutorial doesn't mention the new functionality yet.
[ ] There is a pretty low code coverage - only 77%.
[ ] The doc analysis tool shows lots of issues.
[ ] I get a failing test::

    1) testIterateTrace(ezcDebugXdebugStacktraceIteratorTest)
    Incorrect stack element 0.
    Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.
