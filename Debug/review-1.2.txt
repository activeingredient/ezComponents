[ ] ezcDebug::getStackTrace() is not documented.
[ ] ezcDebugException: component level exceptions should always be abstract,
    and thus there needs to be a new more specific exceptions. (See
    http://ezcomponents.org/contributing/coding_standards#exceptions)
[ ] The example stylesheet misses classes for the stack trace CSS classes.
[ ] ezcDebugStacktraceIterator::__construct() should really be the first method
    in the class.
[ ] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool has the constants undocumented.
[ ] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool::getPropertyVisibility uses expressions in in the
    case statement, that's quite confusing to read. I prefer the use of
    "if/else" here.
[ ] ezcDebugVariableDumpTool::getPropertyValue - there is a TODO, can you check
    that for PHP 5.2.1 and up?
[ ] The ezcDebug class docs don't mention anything about the options, so how do
    I know where to set them? It's because the properties of the class are not
    documented, but the class doc block itself should mention it additionally
    as well.
[ ] The variable output in stack traces should be configurable, like Xdebug.
    There is way too much output by default now making them quite useless.
[ ] The tutorial doesn't mention the new functionality yet.

[ ] The doc analysis tool shows lots of issues.
