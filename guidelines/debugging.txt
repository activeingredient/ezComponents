General debugging guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dumping data
============
Don't use print_r for dumping values of a variable, use var_dump instead. Also
var_export might be of use.

XDebug
======
At all times have XDebug installed and use its features, it will dramatically
reduce the implementation and debugging time.  Some of the interesting features
are:

* Function traces, this can easily provide clues about performance and
  dependency issues.

Errors and warnings
===================

To avoid dependency on a specific debug class, debugging and error handling
must only rely on the internal PHP functions.

To notify a debug message use:

    trigger_error( "a debug message" );

Just make sure you **NEVER** leave debug message in commited code.

To notify a warning message use:

    trigger_error( "a warning message", E_USER_WARNING );

To notify an error message use:

    trigger_error( "an error message", E_USER_ERROR );
