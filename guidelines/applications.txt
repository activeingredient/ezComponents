Application examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These applications will be made to showcase the functionality in the
components. They are not meant to be feature rich but rather show how to
quickly setup working applications using only the components and builtin PHP
functionality.

Lister
======

This application lists directories in similar fashion to the 'ls' program.

SYNOPSIS
--------

    ::

      list [OPTION]... [FILE]...

List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).

Options
-------

-a, --all        do not hide entries starting with .

--color=WHEN     control whether color is used to distinguish file types. WHEN
                 may be never, always, or auto

-d, --directory  list directory entries instead of contents, and do not
                 dereference symbolic links

-l               use a long listing format

Components
----------

1. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleParameter is used to read in parameters.

2. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleOutut is used to output the directory formats using
   color highlighting for files and dirs.


Web downloader
==============

This application downloads HTML pages and binary files from Web pages using
HTTP.

SYNOPSIS
--------

    ::

      webget [OPTION]... [URL]...

Downloads all HTML or binary file specified by URLs to the local filesystem.

Options
-------

--http-user=USER      connect to server with user USER

--http-password=PWD   connect to server with password PWD

Components
----------

1. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleParameter is used to read in parameters.

2. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleProgressBar is used to output the current download
   progress.


SQL frontend
============

This application executes SQL queries to the connected database. It is
interactive and reads each query from the input line.
It supports any database type that the DB backend supports however the entered
SQLs are passed directly to the database server.

SYNOPSIS
--------

    ::

      sqlf [OPTION]... [DSN | DATABASE]

Connects to the given database using a DSN or multiple OPTIONs and the
DATABASE.

Options
-------

-u USER, --user=USER      connect to database with user USER

-p PWD, --password=PWD    connect to database with password PWD

-h HOST, --host=HOST      connect to database on server HOST, default is
                          localhost.

-S SOCK, --socket=SOCKET  connect to database using socket SOCK, this only
                          works for some database servers. Socket connection is
                          the default for some database when HOST is
                          localhost.

-P PORT, --port=PORT      connect to database port PORT, if this is used any
                          SOCK values will be ignored

Note: This application will require readline support in PHP.

Components
----------

1. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleParameter is used to read in parameters.

2. ConsoleTools::ezcConsoleTable is used to format the result of the executed
   SQLs.

3. Database::ezcDatabase is used to connect to the given database and execute
   the SQLs.
