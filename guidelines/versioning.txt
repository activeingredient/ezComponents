Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

Format
======
Versions for components have three elements: x.y.z, which have the following
meaning:

x
	major version number, when its 0 the component is a beta component. A
	component with major version 0 can never be release publically. When the
	number != 0 then it will only increase when there is a backwards compatible
	break in the component's API.

y
	minor version number, is used for all feature additions

z
	mini version number, is used to denote bugfixes only. This third part can
	also be a string in the set: (alpha, beta1, beta2, betaN, rc1, rc2, rcN) -
	in that case it shows that the package is a "beta" package, not ready for
	production.

x and y show the version number of the component, the z is an addition showing
the state (beta etc) or which bugfix release it is.
