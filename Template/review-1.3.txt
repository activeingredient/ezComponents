Template object in custom functions / blocks
============================================

- The Template object is given as the first parameter to functions/methods
  realizing a custom block or function, if activated via $sendTemplateObject.
  Wouldn't it be better to make it be used as the last parameter for BC
  reasons?
- The tests for this feature could be more exact, they only check
  get_class($template->usedConfiguration), which should usually be the same.
  I'd expect that they check of the correct Template instance was submitted.

Fixed issue #11228: Cannot supply an absolute Win32-Path to $t->process()
=========================================================================

- The patch (r5906:5889) does not seem to fix the actual issue for me, since
  it only replaces ezcBaseFile::isAbsolutepath() with a manual check for
  absolute Unix pathes. Absolute Windows pathes should still not be
  recognized.
- The test also do not reflect the behavior indicated by the issue title.

Location suppport
=================

- Does not seem to be tested, `grep -r -i 'locator' Template/tests/*|grep -v svn`
  gave no results.

Implementation of {capture}
===========================

- Seems not to be mentioned in the ChangeLog.
- Why are type hints in ezcTemplateCaptureTstNode::__construct() and
  ezcTemplateTstNode::__construct() commented?

Misc
====

- Variable amount of parameters for functions not mentioned in ChangeLog.
- Variable amount of parameters for blocks not mentioned in ChangeLog.
- Variable amount of parameters for blocks seems not to be tested.

- Why does the date_format() template function also support timestamps and not
  only DateTime objects? Though we have date_format_timestam() for these.
  date_format() should throw an exception if not a DateTime object is received
  of date_format_timestamp() should dispatch to ezcTemplateDate::date(), too.
  I'd prefer the first solution.

- "Made named parameters work with PHP 5.1.6." is a bit misleading, since
  actually an exception is throwen if < 5.2.

- The tutorial SVN log does not note that any of the changes made it in the
  tutorial so far.
