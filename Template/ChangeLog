^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added "web" functions.
- Added "date" functions.
- Added the raw tag that outputs raw, without context, values.
- Fixed a bug that arrays and properties could not be send as expression
  part of the include construct. E.g. {include "abc.ezt" send $a[0] as $b}
- Fixed a bug that property fetches were ignored after the first fetch. 
  E.g. {$obj->prop1->prop2}
- Fixed a bug that the variable is declared in the 'as' part of the include.  
  E.g. {include "abc.ezt" send $a as $b}, $b was declared.
- Fixed a bug that using parenthesis in an 'if' block gave an error message.
  E.g. {if ( true ) }
- Fixed a bug that a function call after a property fetch would give an error
  message. E.g. {$mail->myProp} {str_len( $mail->myProp)}
- Fixed a bug that the equal, not equal, identical, not identical could not
  compare arrays with arrays and arrays with 'values'.
- Fixed a bug in the get_class function. Due to a spelling error it would
  throw a PHP Fatal Error.

  allowed. E.g. {5 + -   3} 
- Fixed a bug that the break and continue tags could contain garbage.
  E.g. {break abcd}
- Fixed a bug that the column number in error messages were incorrect.
- Fixed a bug that the hash_intersect_key function was mapped wrong.
- Fixed bug #8280: Array assignment with non-constants not working.
- All compile errors throw the ezcTemplateParserException.  Removed the 
  ezcTemplateSourceToTstParserException.
- Renamed the functions: str_trimmed, str_trimmed_left, str_trimmed_right,
  and str_simplified to respectively str_trim, str_trim_left, str_trim_right, 
  and str_simplify. 
- The modulo part of the delimiter is now optional.
