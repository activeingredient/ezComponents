TODO
====

- Handle external URLs in path factory and backends (Bail out with 502 - Bad
  Gateway)

- Add validity checks for $name (XML tag) and $namspace (URI) properties to
  ezcWebdavDeadProperty.

- Desing interface for ezcWebdavTransport extensions (must follow client
  dispatching)

  - How to deal with unknown properties in the DAV: namespace? We currently
	just ignore them.

- Check how to deal with namespaces in dead properties.

- Memory backend does not support emulation of client test case rfc/proppatch.

  - Error emulation would need to be highly more flexible.

- ezcWebdavDateTime is a temporary solution for the issue that DateTime is
  currently not correctly serializable. Will this be fixed? We just need it for
  testing, though.

- Client test case litmus/113_props__3_propfind_invalid2 reflects the issue,
  that we can not reject invalid XML properly. a) the DAV: namespace is invalid
  by itself. b) DOM does not bail out on loading an XML string without proper
  XML declaration. WebDAV defines to reject "invalid" issues.

- Header handling needs to be refactored to allow plugins to access them.
