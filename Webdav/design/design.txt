Scope
=====

The scope of this document is to describe the initial design of a component
that provides a webdav server and a webdav client, which work with all major
other implementations of the WebDAV_ protocol.

.. _WebDAV_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV

The client part of the component is not part of the initial design and will
therefore be added in a future version.

Design overview
===============

Because of the variaty of buggy and incomplete implementations of WebDAV, this
component will provide an abstraction to suite the different needs. Beside
that, an abstract interface to the backend used for file operations will be
provided.

The main class of this component will provide a fully `RFC 2518`_ compliant
implementation of a WebDAV_ server. An instance of this class retrieves an
instance of a handler class, which takes care for performing the requested
operations on a backend (for example the filesystem).

.. _`RFC 2518`: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518

Additionally, a collection of classes, which inherit the main class will be
provided. Each of this classes will provide a compatibility layer on top of the
RFC implementation, which works correctly with one or more "buggy" WebDAV
clients. A factory pattern implementation will be provided, which takes
automatically care of creating the correct server instance for a client.
