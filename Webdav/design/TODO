TODO
====

- Handle external URLs in path factory and backends (Bail out with 502 - Bad
  Gateway)

- Add validity checks for $name (XML tag) and $namspace (URI) properties to
  ezcWebdavDeadProperty.

- Desing interface for ezcWebdavTransport extensions (must follow client
  dispatching)

- How to deal with unknown properties in the DAV: namespace? We currently just
  ignore them.

- Check how to deal with namespaces in dead properties.

- How do we want to handle property validation errors? On proppatch a selective
  409 should be send for broken property values - but until now we cant handle
  this exception in the backend or anywhere else during response generation.
