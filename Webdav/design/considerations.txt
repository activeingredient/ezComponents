===============================
Additional Implementation Notes
===============================

- Optional metadata validating mechanisms (Dublin core, ...)

- Optional handlers for static files to call before delivering (SSI)

  - Optional 404 handler which may create dynamic ressources? Just a stupid
	get to the backend is probably sufficant?

- Optionally enforce locking?

  - Prevents HTTP clients from modifying ressources.
