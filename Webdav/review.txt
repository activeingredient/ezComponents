---------------------------

- The docs folder contains many text files - are they to become pages in the
online documentation? I think the place to put this temporary text files is
design or even the root of Webdav. (the root is the place to put TODO anyway)

- The option class ezcWebdavMemoryBackendOptions contain constants defined
which are used in ezcWebdavMemoryBackend (and maybe other classes). Is this
the correct way to do things? I think the constants should be defined
in ezcWebdavMemoryBackend.

- There is no tutorial.

- ezcWebdavMemoryBackend, ezcWebdavSimpleBackend and maybe other classes have
the extends and implements on many lines - I thought it was already discussed
on IRC to have everything on one line.

- Sometimes constructors are documented with '@return void'. I thought we
don't write the '@return void' anymore (for constructors much less).

- Some methods don't have code blocks.

- Some classes have the description 'Description missing'.

- Instead of array_key_exists( $propertyName, $this->properties ) it can be
isset( $this->properties[$propertyName] ) (in __isset() methods) for speed.

- Almost all the components have this order in the docblocks for methods:
   - short description
   - detailed description, examples
   - @throws
   - @param
   - @return

Why in Webdav the order is different?
