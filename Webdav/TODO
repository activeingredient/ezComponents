TODO
====

- ezcWebdavDateTime is a temporary solution for the issue that DateTime is
  currently not correctly serializable. Will this be fixed? We just need it for
  testing, though.

- Add test for mime type file info extensions

- URL encoding, UTF-8 and other charsets?

- Client initial request to deeper URLs for IE?

- Some DAV clients request logs exactly after the time they requested the lock
  to last. If the request now takes too much time, it may result in an error,
  since the lock is already gone.

- Some information was provided by the attendees of "Webdav with eZ Components"
  at the IPC2007:
  - When a resource is created, clients may provide the getcreationdate
	property (and other date properties), to keep the original dates in tact.
	We currently don't support this at all, it seems, and some (Windows)
	clients seem to provide invalid dates. At least, an attendee described that
	he got 1970-01-01 after uploading a file to mod_webdav.
  - Windows' case-insensitivity with filenames must be checked!
  - Charsets different to UTF-8 must be checked. How do we support them? Do we
	convert everything that is plain text to UTF-8 for storing? Do we need to
	overwrite php.ini settings to always send UTF-8? Do we simply store the
	charset provided and set correct headers on GET? Especially important is to
	check German and other languages Umlauts.
