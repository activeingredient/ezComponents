Design Description
==================

Purpose of Graph package
------------------------

The Graph package will be used to generate different chart types from a user
defined set of data. There will be 2D and 3D presentations for each chart
type.

Classes
-------

ezcGraphManager
	Controller for the generated graphs. Offers factory methods for the other
	classes, handles and dispatches the configuration and actions to the other
	classes.

ezcGraphDataset
	Receives the user data, and stores the configuration for the dataset, like
	color, label, etc. Contains a finite count of ezcGraphDatasetData objects.
	Can be extended to perform algorithms like polynomial interpolation, 
	averaging and bezier interpolation on the data.

ezcGraphChart
	Abstract class, which handles the global charts options like background
	colors or images. Aggregates ezcGraphChartElement for configurable sub
	elements.

ezcGraphChartPie
	Extends ezcGraphChart for pie charts. Offers additional options for pie
	charts like tresh hold under which data is combined.

ezcGraphChartLine
	Extends ezcGraphChart for line charts. Additionally contains two objects
	to represent and configure the axes.

ezcGraphChartElement
	Abstract class to define the interface how to access the configuration
	directives of different chart elements like axes and legend.

ezcGraphChartElementLegend
	Offers configuration options for the charts legend like background color,
	position and size.

ezcGraphChartElementAxe
	Offers the axes configuration options like scaling, lines within the
	graph and labeling. Can do automagic scaling of the axes.

ezcGraphRenderer
	Abstract class which transforms the chart elements like pie segments,
	bars, texts and lines to image primitives depending on the renderer.

ezcGraphRenderer2D
	Creates image primitives for the chart elements considered as two
	dimensional.

ezcGraphRenderer3D
	Creates image primitives for the chart elements considered as three
	dimensional.

ezcGraphDriver
	Offers methods to draw image primitives like textboxes, arcs, rectangles,
	polygons and lines. Needs to be extended for each output format.

ezcGraphDriverGD
	Creates PNG images utilizing the GDlib bundled with PHP.

Implementation
==============

ezcGraphManagager
-----------------

Offers factory methods to build up the wanted graph, containing a chart of a
selected type, a renderer and a driver. Once aggregated the manager offers an
unified interface to configure all parts of the graph.

The manager can aggregate a finite count of datasets and forwards the to the
chart. The chart builds the visual chart elements like pie segments, lines or
bars, which are forwarded to the renderer. They are transformed to image 
primitives accoringly to the selected renderer.

The datasets can be configured individually by the user of the package.

Data Structures
===============

ezcGraphDatasetData
	Stores the data and offers options to set color and label for single
	potions of data. Data can be highlighted, the presentation depends on the
	charttype (Label value in line charts, move pie outwards in pie charts).
