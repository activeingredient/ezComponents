/**
 * Interface to be implemented by stack replacement strategies.
 *
 * This interface is to be implemented by replacement strategy classes, which
 * can be configured to be used by an {@link ezcCacheStack}. The defined
 * methods wrap around their counterparts on {@link ezcCacheStorage}.
 *
 * A replacement strategy must take care about the actual
 * storing/restoring/deleting of cache items in the given storage. In addition
 * it must take care about keeping the needed meta data actual and about
 * purging data from the cache storage, if it runs full.
 *
 * The {@link ezcCacheStackMetaData} is used to store information needed by
 * the replacement process, as well as information about the state of the
 * storages in the stack and if an item is available in it at all.
 * 
 * @package Cache
 * @version //autogentag//

     * The items $itemId and potential $itemAttributes are given for that
     * purpose. The $storageConfiguration contains an instance of {@link
     * ezcCacheStackableStorage} which must be used for storing.
     *
     * In addition to these parameters, the method receives the $metaData
     * struct that should be used to store the meta information needed by the
     * replacement strategy. To enable this further information about the
     * storage (like its ID in the stack) are given in the
     * $storageConfiguration. The meta data should be updated, if an item is
     * successfully stored, as necessary.
     *
     * The $storageConfiguration also contains the $itemLimit and $freeRate
     * settings, which need to be obeyd.  If $itemLimit is reached and the
     * store() method is called, the $freeRate ammount of $itemLimit needs to
     * be cleaned up in the $storage. To achieve this, first the {@link
     * ezcCacheStackableStorage->purge()} method should be used, to remove all
     * outdated content. The method returns an array of cache item ids, to
     * enable the replacement strategy to remove its data accordingly. If this
     * does not reach the desired $freeRate in the cache, items need to be
     * deleted according to the replacement strategy itself, in addition.
     * Therefore the {@link ezcCacheStackableStorage->delete()} method also
     * returns an array of item IDs for updating the meta data.
