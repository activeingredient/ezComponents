/**
 * Hierarchical caching class using multiple storages.

 * An instance of this class can be used to achieve so called "hierarchical
 * caching". A cache stack consists of an arbitrary number of cache storages,
 * being sorted from top to bottom. Usually this order reflects the speed of
 * access for the caches: The fastest cache is at the top, the slowest at the
 * bottom.

 * @todo More documentation, examples,...
