===========================

[ ] the tutorial needs to be updated with the new stackable storage.

[ ] run docanalisys.php on Cache:
    - missing method docblocks.
    - missing or wrong parameters.
    - @deprecated tag could be instead @apichange? It is not recognized.

[ ] xdebug_start_trace() and xdebug_stop_trace() in complex_stack_test.php on
    line 307 and 309.

[ ] investigate which version of APC is needed? Some tests fail with APC 3.0.14
    (I got "missing apc_add() function" but maybe it was not compiled correctly).
	I also needed apc.enable_cli=1 in php.ini which I didn't know - specify this
    somewhere?

[ ] 2 failed tests in ezcCacheStorageMemcachePlainTest:

1) testPurgeNoLimit(ezcCacheStorageMemcachePlainTest)
Purged IDs not returned correctly.
Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.
