Review Alexandru 2009-07-31
===========================

[ ] new tests storage_object_test.php depend on classes/exportable.php which
    is not in SVN. Hence the Cache test suite fails.

[ ] ezcCacheStorageFileObject does not follow our whitespace guidelines

[ ] the file storage_object_test.php contains references to ezcStorageFileArray

[ ] cache_autoload.php references ezcCacheFileObjectSerializer which doesn't exist

[ ] tests/suite.php references ezcCacheStorageFileObjectTest which doesn't exist
