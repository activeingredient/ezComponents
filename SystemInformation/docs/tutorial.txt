.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

The System Information component provides access to common system variables, 
such as CPU type and speed, available amount of memory etc. 
Currently, the system information supports Linux, FreeBSD and Windows systems.

Class overview
==============

ezcSystemInfo
  This class provides the main API for accessing common system variables.
  Variables that ara not available from PHP directly are fetched using readers
  specific for each supported system. The corresponding reader is automatically
  detected, attached and forced to scan the systems information.
  
ezcSystemInfoReader
  The ezcSystemInfoReader represents a common abstract interface for OS info 
  readers. A particular reader implements the ezcSystemInfoReader interface and 
  scana system infoformation specifically for each supported OS.
 
More information about these classes can be found in the documentation of the
classes itself.
