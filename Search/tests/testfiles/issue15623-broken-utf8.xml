<p>Only use r√√ferences where it is really needed, references do not increase
performance (as one might think). There are many pitfalls with reference usage
so stay away.</p>
<p>Don't use @ in front of functions, this makes it much harder to debug. If
you have to, a comment before it is <em>required</em>.</p>
<p>Use real static functions, never use fake static (or semi-static)
functions. Real static functions will not include the $this variable from the
calling function.</p>
<p>Avoid dependencies at all costs, each class should be a small a unit as
possible.</p>
<p>Use join() function instead of implode(), this makes the code easier to
read.</p>
