Review Alexandru 2009-08-03
===========================

[ ] issue #14916 (extract help) doesn't have any tests

[ ] ezcConsoleStandardInputHelpGenerator - shouldn't it be named
    ezcConsoleInputStandardHelpGenerator?

[ ] some method signatures don't reflect the doc blocks, eg.
    generateGroupedOptionHelp()

[ ] @return array(int=>array(int=>string)) can be written easier as
    @return array(array(string)) as we do in other components

[ ] for issue #15010 the file testTableWithoutFormatting.dat does not
    exist in the windows folder. There are actually 15 files or so
    which are missing from the windows folder and prevent testing
    on Windows.
