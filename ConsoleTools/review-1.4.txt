===========================

[ ] Regarding #10765 (new MappingValidator for yes/no dialogs) - It is not
    documented or mentioned in the tutorial.

	Why is $this->properties['map'] = array(); in the constructor? $this-map
    is assigned on the following line anyway.

	The @property tag for ezcConsoleDialogQuestionMappingValidator contain a wrong
    description for $conversion - TYPE_* instead of CONVERT_* constants. Same for
    other validator classes.
