  <title>Overloaded properties (__get)</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/overloaded_properties_get.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
While checking whether the &lt;a href="http://components.ez.no"&gt;eZ
components&lt;/a&gt; would run with the latest PHP 5.2 release candidate we
noticed that there are some things that are not backwards compatible
with PHP 5.1.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first issue is an extra notice in some cases. In our (&lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/latest/(file)/Mail/ezcMailTools.html"&gt;ezcMailTools&lt;/a&gt;)
class we implement a method that allows you to "reply" to a
parsed e-mail message. In this method we have the folowing code:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
static public function replyToMail( ezcMail $mail )
{
// ...
    foreach ( $mail-&amp;gt;to as $address )
    {
// ...
    }
// ...
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you can see we loop over one of the seemingly public variables of the
$mail class. However, the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/latest/(file)/Mail/ezcMail.html"&gt;ezcMail&lt;/a&gt;
class does not have this as a public member variable, but instead uses
&lt;a href="http://no.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php"&gt;overload&lt;/a&gt;
as you can see in this code snippet:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
public function __get( $name )
{
    switch ( $name )
    {
        case 'to':
            return $this-&amp;gt;properties[$name];
    }
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This all works 'fine' with PHP 5.1, however with PHP 5.2 the following
notice was generated for this code:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property ezcMail::$to has no
effect in ../Mail/src/tools.php on line 364
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The reason for this is that __get() only returns variables in read mode,
while foreach() wants a variable in read/write mode as it tries to
modify the internal array pointer. As it can't do this PHP 5.2 will now
throw a warning on this.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a workaround however in the form of casting it to an array.
After our &lt;a href="http://lists.ez.no/pipermail/svn-components/2006-August/002539.html"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;
the code now looks like:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
public function __get( $name )
{
    switch ( $name )
    {
        case 'to':
            return (array) $this-&amp;gt;properties[$name];
    }
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second issue is related to this. In this case we did not see an
extra notice but instead a fatal error:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fatal error: Cannot assign by reference to overloaded object in
.../trunk/Url/src/url.php on line 242
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The code around this line is:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if ( array_key_exists( $index, $this-&amp;gt;path ) )
{
    $this-&amp;gt;path[$name] =&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;path[$index];
}

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this case $this-&gt;path is also an overloaded property returning an
array. Because __get() returns a read-only variable assigning a
reference can not work as that requires a variable to be in read/write
mode. Most likely the code didn't work properly in PHP 5.1 either but
luckily this is still in an unreleased component. However, I am not
aware of a work-around here.
		&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>PHP 4.4.3 Released</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/php_443_released.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
I just released PHP 4.4.3 which brings a number of security fixes (and
other fixes) that were backported from the PHP 5.1 branch. None of the
security issues are very critical, but it is a good idea to
upgrade anyway as you never know what clever ways people come up with
to try to hack your servers :)
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/release_4_4_3.php"&gt;the release
announcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.3"&gt;The ChangeLog&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is not the last PHP 4.4 relase and the PHP team will continue to
support it for some years to come.

  <title>Iceland - Fire and Water</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/iceland_fire_and_water.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
Most people don't mention "Iceland" as their top number one
holiday destination. However I'm a bit strange and decided to go to
just this place on holiday this year. After some investigations it
seemed that the best time of year was somewhere around the end of July
regarding temparature, however you never know certain about what to
expect. That means packing all types of clothes... summer
clothes, but also a thick winter jacket, skiing clothes and rain
clothes. Of course, depending on what you are going to do exactly. I
wanted to see all possible types of terrain on iceland, which includes
nice warm lagoons (swim wear) and glacier (warm clothes is a good idea
there). Flights to Iceland are not very cheap either, but then again,
nor is anything else cheap on Iceland. (Yes, the alcohol tax is even
higher than in Norway). After a bit of investigation in the different
points-of-interest on Iceland with the help of some locals (thanks
Helgi and Bjori!) and the Lonely Planet I headed to Iceland with a
friend on July 6th.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
101 Reykjavik
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After getting to Keflavik airport way to late at night we managed to
find our way to the guesthouse just to find that I fluked the
reservation and they they expected us to arrive the next day. That
meant that we had to sleep in "sleeping bag accomodations"
which was not so confortable but I really didn't care after this overly
long trip. A guesthouse is normally just a small step down from a hotel
usually without people cleaning up your room every day. It does however
provide a good and somewhat cheaper place to stay at.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-bluelagoon.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next day we toured around Reykjavik and the Reykjanes peninsula a
bit and basically just waited until our room at the guest house was
ready. After a well needed shower to get rid of all the smells we met
up with a local and headed for a relaxing bath in the Blue Lagoon, the
most famous (but definitely not the only) geothermal pool in Iceland.
Helgi suggested to have dinner at ... and so we went there for a good
meal. The best meat in Iceland is sheep or lamb and you figure out why
once you start out driving in the country side... the only animal that
you'd find there is sheep... and you find them literally everywhere -
both off the road and on the roads.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Þingvellír (Thingvellir)
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-thingvellir.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt;
Iceland begun quite some time ago with the first parliament ever in
930. The parliament was build on a site called Þingvellír which is
now part of a national park. Besides the site of the former parliament
the general landscape is also quite interesting as well as there is a
massive lava ridge cutting across the landscape there as well as some
water filled gorges and (ofcourse) a waterfall. From Þingvellír we
avoided the ring road on the way back to Reykjavik and instead took
some road closer to the south of the country. Little did we know as
suddendly the road turned into a gravel road which we had to follow for
the next, say, 50 kilometers. The road did however pass an interesting
site with lots of water coming up from the ground in bright coloured
mud pools.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Water
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As proper tourists we visited two other popular sites the next day.
Starting off on the southern ring road we left busy Reykjavik to visit
"Geysir".
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Before we ended up at the geysirs we drove past the Keriđ explosion
crater. We actually tried to have a look at this one the day before but
our map had it in a totally wrong place, however my GPS map (!! add
link) did have it correctly. (!! add stuff about this event). All that
as left now is a crater which now houses a small lake in the middle.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-strokkur.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt; The
English word geysir finds its origin in exactly the site which formerly
housed this great natural water fountain in Iceland. However, in the
last few years the original geysir does no longer function properly and
only rarely spits out its water into the air. However at the same site
there is another geysir called Strokkur which still performs well.
About every 5 to 10 minutes it bursts out water into the air, however
each bursts intensity varies quite a bit. You need to be a bit lucky to
see a "big one". Besides Strokkur there are also a number of
smaller less regular geysirs and "Bluesi" - a very blue pool
with warm water.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From the geysir field we then proceeded towards Gullfoss - the Golden
Falls - named because its always present rainbow. However... if there
is no sun there won't be a rainbow either ofcourse. We were lucky and
the weather was fair so we could enjoy the magic of the great falls.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Past the great glacier
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-puffin.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
Leaving Reykjavik behind we set off for Höfn (pronounced like
"Hùb"). Along this route there are many smaller and larger
waterfalls including one of Iceland's finest called
"Seljalandsfoss". We went to see a few of those and then
wandered off the ring road to have a look at the Dyrhólaey plateau
where there is a large colony of puffins as well. We spend some time
trying to get as close to the puffins as possible for a good photo and
then proceeded our route to Höfn. When driving along the southern ring
road we passed lots of lava fields and glacier tongues. The glacier
toungues are all part of the largest icecap of Europe: Vatnajökull.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-glacier.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
About an hour before Höfn we passed the Jökulsárlón bay which is
filled with icebergs from the Breiđamerkurjökull glacier. This bay
gives a very strange feeling as it looks like it just comes out of a
movie. Coincidentally we figured out later that parts of a James Bond
film (Die Another Day) was shot here on this bay. Höfn itself is a
tiny tiny town with little to do, however we would only use it as base
camp for our glacier expedition.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hike on Svínafellsjökull glacier
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The next morning we left early from Höfn to be on time for our 10
o'clock appointment with the Icelandic Mountain Guides. This little
plan of ours almost went wrong because at the Jökulsárlón bay they
where working on the bridge which set us back by about 20 minutes. We
barely made it on time to the base camp of the mountain guides just to
find that they had us down for 14:00 and not 10:00. Luckily there was
still some space for us in the 10:00 tour. There was not much Icelandic
about our guide as he was there on an exchange project from New Zealand:
Ben. Ben took us out on a trip over the lower parts of the
Svínafellsjökull glacier and explained us about the different things
that make up a glacier. Basically a glacier is just compressed snow but
because of gravity this compressed mass starts moving down the valleys
until there is a point where the sun is winning from the accumulation
of snow. Here the glacier melts and ends. Between the main icecap
Vatnajökull and the edge are the glacier valleys and ice falls. Just
after we came off the glacier it started to pour so we just drove back
to Höfn and stayed in. I managed to assemble most of my panoramas and
manage all my photos that I'd taken so far.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From Höfn to Akureyri
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rain, rain and more rain was the case this day as well when we passed
past numerous bays and inlets on the eastern side of Iceland and later
through high plains with lava fields. Somewhat closer to Myvatn we made
a small detour to see the Krafla region's vulcanic activity but bad wind
and rain killed that plan. We did manage to have a look at the Krafla
power station where electricity is won from earth heated water in the
form of steam. The small tour of the plant was done by a girl who've
had this summer job for the past 4 years and was happy to answer our
questions, especially because were not so loud as the three tour busses
that left when we just got there I suppose. We promised to come back to
the Krafla area to see more of it the next day as weather was supposed
to improve a lot.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Waterfalls and Vulcanoes
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And indeed the weather did improve. With 18°C and sunny it was the
perfect day to investigate some of the waterfalls in the area and then
head back to the Krafla region. First on the menu was Gođafoss, which
is situated very close to the ring road itself. From there on we went
to the Ásbyrgi canyon on the north side of the road that leads to
Dettifoss. The road that leads to Dettifoss is a 25 km long gravel road
(doesn't matter from which end) that goes over some very intersting
landscape which can only be similar to something as remote as the moon.
There are actually multiple waterfalls in this river and you can get
close to three without too much walking. The first one is
Hafragillsfoss, which is rather uninspiring as you can see Dettifoss'
spray in the background already. Dettifoss is actually quite ugly with
black water but it is the most powerful waterfall in Iceland so you
shouldn't really miss it.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-pothole.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt; From
the same carpark that serves Dettifoss it's a nice 1.5 km hike to the
third waterfall that you can get to, Selfoss. After visiting those
three falls we proceeded southward to end up in the Krafla region, this
time with some sun. Now the rain was gone we could actually see the big
Viti explosion crater and walk a bit around it. Another popular hike
here is the one around Lernhjúkur that takes you through a geothermic
area with lots of hot springs and the lava fields that were created
with the latest erruptions in this area. You can quite clearly show
where the lava came from and how it flowed. It was also clear that the
area is still active as the ground was usually warm and there were lots
of steam vents spraying bad smelling vapor into the air. Nearby is the
Hverarönd area which also has a lot of interesting pools.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Dimmuborgir
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-dimmu.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On our last day on the North side of the country we again traveled to
the Myvatn area to see Dimmuborgir, the black castles. However before
we went there we tried to have a look at some intersting lava pillars
that can be found just inside the lake. It is quite obvious why the
name of the lake is Myvatn (Mosquito lake) as the were literally swarms
of mosquitoes attacking us as soon as we got out of the car. Even at the
Dimmuborgir site the mosquitoes were quite persistent however not as bad
as closer to the lake. Dimmuborgir has some intersting formations of
lava resembling buildings and even a church. On the way back we also
visited the Laufás farm museum which has some restored old homes.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To the west
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-kirkufjell.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
After Akureyri we traveled to the Snæfellsness peninsula on the west
of Iceland. Unfortunately this day was again full of rain and lots of
wind so we didn't really see a lot besides dirt against the car window.
We stayed in a tiny town called Grundarfjórdur in a tiny but cosy hotel
which also serves as the local restaurant. The town lies under the realm
of Kirkufjell which we actually couldn't quite see just yet. With
promises that the weather would clear up the next day we headed for bed
early.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Snæfellsness Peninsula
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/is-arnarstapi.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt;
At the westernern part of Iceland is the Snæfellsness peninsula with
its main feature being the Snæfellsnessjökull glacier. But there are
many more sites along the coast, although some of them might be a hard
to get to. The Lonely Planet helped here a bit and we eventually made
it to some very little traveled place: Öndsverdnes - the most western
point of Europe - Very remote and actually quite boring. However when
traveling further south along the coast the weather cleared and we had
some nice walks along the coast near Arnarstapi where the water carved
out interesting features in the rocks. The small hikes here however
were the end of the holiday as we needed to head back for Reykjavik to
catch the next day's early morning flight.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Pictures
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/phpw_button_Speaker_2006.gif' align='left' alt=''/&gt;I'll be speaking at
&lt;a href="http://phparch.com/works"&gt;php|works&lt;/a&gt; (September 12-14)
on a couple of subjects. The first talk I will do is on input
filtering, especially going into the new filter extension but also
covering some other forms as well. The conference also features the
return of "Derick's Ranting Hour" where I invite the audience
to come up with subjects regrading what they hate and love about PHP.
The third session I will give is on the &lt;a href="http://components.ez.no"&gt;eZ components&lt;/a&gt; introducing the cool
new things that we've added, and will be adding, for the next version.
Hope to see you there!

  <title>Xdebug 2.0beta6</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/xdebug_20beta6.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
I am currently in Sofia attending the &lt;a href="http://www.wtconferences.com/2006/index.php?id=6,0,0,1,0,0"&gt;webtech&lt;/a&gt;
conference. However some of the talks are in Bulgarian which makes it
quite hard to follow. (There is translation available, but it is still
not easy). So, instead of going to the sessions I finalized some
optimization patches for &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org"&gt;Xdebug&lt;/a&gt;. I
managed to find and fix some performance bottlenecks with cachegrind.
Xdebug usually tries to figure out which variables are available in a
specific function's scope by iterating over the op array that is being
excuted. However, in many cases this is totally useles as the
information is never used in any way. With the patch Xdebug will only
try to figure out this information when either remote debugging is
enabled, or when the setting xdebug.show_local_vars is activated. This
speeds up certain applications by as much as 50%. This patch, and many
others, made it into Xdebug 2.0.0beta6 which I just released through
PECL. The source code is also avaible through the Xdebug website.

  <title>Back to Normal</title>

  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
The last week has been a bit crazy because of the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/company/events/ez_publish_conference_2006"&gt;eZ
publish&lt;/a&gt; conference. The whole week was packed with all kinds of
activities.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that life returned to normal busyness I managed to recover my photos
from New York. (I wiped them off my memory card... which is not smart).
The photos from the New York trip are &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/nyphpcon2006"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During last week there were several different events as well. On Tuesday
we had a crew day where I for the first time met all of my
collegues. And the last weekend there was &lt;a href="http://phpvikinger.org/"&gt;PHP Vikinger&lt;/a&gt; - an unconference
about PHP related things.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All events were very succesful. Photos can be found &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/ezconf2006"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>Typehints for scalar types</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/typehints_for_scalar_types.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
An attendee at the &lt;a href="http://phpnycon.com"&gt;PHP New York
Conference&lt;/a&gt; asked me on some tips on how to implement typehinting
for scalar types (integer, float, string, boolean...). In about 20
minutes I explained how it could be done, but I got a bit bored at my
flight back so I finished the &lt;a href="http://files.derickrethans.nl/patches/ze-type-hint-2006-06-17.diff.txt"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;
already. The patch is most likely not the best way of implementing this
either, and I am also not sure if this patch should be applied to PHP's
CVS at all. It might be useful for people that have more control over
their PHP setup so I decided to publish it here instead.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides the four scalar types it also allows the "object" type
hint which will allow objects of any class to be passed. A small example
is here:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
class blah {
}
function foo1( object $a )
{
}
$b = new blah;
foo1( $b );
function foo2( integer $i, float $f, bool $b )
{
}
foo2( 'string', 42, 49.9 );

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The example above should show:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Catchable fatal error: Argument 1 passed to foo2() must be of type
integer, string given, called in /tmp/test.php on line 16 and defined
in /tmp/test.php on line 12

  <title>Debugging Protocol Shoot-out (Part 2)</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/debugging_protocol_shootout_part_2.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://guyharpaz.blogspot.com/"&gt;Guy Harpaz&lt;/a&gt; posted a
reply to my &lt;a href="http://derickrethans.nl/debugging_protocol_shootout.php"&gt;Debugger
Protocol Shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; on his newly created blog. In this &lt;a href="http://guyharpaz.blogspot.com/2006/05/php-ide-debug-protocol.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
he tries to counter some of my arguments. I don't quite understand why
he couldn't just have posted his comments here though. (And in case why
you're wondering why I'm not adding a comment to his post: You need a
blogger.com account to comment, and I refuse to create one just to be
able to comment on a blog).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first thing that strikes me as odd is the following quote:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We chose performance (binary based protocol) over easy
server side implementation (textual based protocol).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Easy implementation was never the reason for going with a textual based
protocol. The main reason was to allow extensions to the protocol be as
easy as possible. Cramming as much data in as little bytes as possible
is also not going to increase performance if your protocol has no ways
to paginate through arrays with many elements or when you have no means
of limiting the amount of data in one variable to be send over the wire.
This is very useful incase you have a few MB files in variables for
example.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second argument why you should "choose Zend Studio's
protocol" is:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
DBGp supports several scripting languages and from this
derives some of its disadvantages. We believe that a debug protocol
should be as 'close' as possible to the PHP language.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This doesn't make much sense to me, as far as I know Eclipse is a multi
language IDE. Secondly, which disadvantages there are is not
mentioned.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then Guy tries to compare some security points:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Proxy mechanism has few bugs in it
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If that is the case, would you mind telling us where?
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He further mentions:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE debug protocol does not specify requirements for
a security system but defines that the Debug server should receive the
client IP before initializing the session. By using the IP,
implementing a security mechanism is very simple.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Xdebug doesn't specify any requirements either. Xdebug could implement
an extra security that checks whether the IP is allowed to be used as
debugging IDE client. However, when you are on a NAT-ted local network,
and your dev server is somewhere outside of this network you have a
problem without a proxy. As there is no way for the debugging engine on
the developer machine to connect to individual IDEs anymore (as the IPs
are simply not accessible by the devel server because of NAT). The
proxy-server based approach of DBGp allows your devel server to connect
to the proxy on one IP and one port (which also means you have to poke
only one hole in your firewall). The IDE then simply have to make
itself known to the proxy server with its "idekey" to allow
debugging through a NAT-ted network.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The last point that Guy raises is:
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
DBGp supports PHP execution stdout and stderr as a general
solution for all supported languages. PHP IDE as a specific protocol
for PHP can distingue between header output and standard output and
between all types of PHP errors (warnings, errors and
notices).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It really has nothing to do whether a protocol is specifically made for
PHP or not to allow the sending of HTTP headers. DBGp currently has no
options for sending headers, but that would not be hard to add. It
definitely would not be the selling point on why somebody should
"choose Zend Studio's protocol".
		&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Debugging Protocol Shoot-out</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/debugging_protocol_shootout.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
(Note: I might be biased as I'm one of the authors of the &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php"&gt;DBGp&lt;/a&gt; protocol.)
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Note: As the PHP IDE project seem to have swapped the meanings of
client and server in their specification I will use the terms
"debugging engine" and "IDE" in this overview)
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Since a few days Zend has &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/php/docs.php"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their
debugging protocol that they're going to implement for their Eclipse
PHP IDE. This protocol is apparently a derivate of the protocol that
they now use for their Zend Studio. Lukas already &lt;a href="http://www.pooteeweet.org/blog/357"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in his
opinion open source should work in such a way that the best technical
solution should be used, but the Eclipse project &lt;a href="http://www.pooteeweet.org/blog/359"&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; to work a bit
different. In order to have a small view on what the "better"
debugging protocol is I made a small comparison between the protocol
that Zend published and &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php"&gt;DBGp&lt;/a&gt; that is used in &lt;a href="http://activestate.com/komodo"&gt;Komodo&lt;/a&gt; and a number of other
commercial, free and open source IDEs.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Protocol Communication
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE protocol is binary while DBGp is an ASCII/XML based format.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A binary protocol uses less data over the wire and will therefore be
faster to transport data with. However a binary protocol is also less
flexible as all data types need to be defined exactly and the protocol
specifications are required to be very rigid. An ASCII/XML based
protocol uses more bandwidth, but it is more flexible as the format
doesn't have to be so rigid. It is also much easier to debug by just
looking at what goes over the wire.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Session Initialization
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE protocol allows you select a host and port to which the
debug engine should connect to the IDE through an HTTP parameter in the
request to the webserver. DBGp does not have such mechanism.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On first sight it seems like a good idea to have the visitor of the web
site to select which host and port to connect to as this makes things
more flexible. However you should realize that not only the person who
is debugging the application and set the host and port, but also
everybody else who is visiting the site. Unless the debugging engine
has configuration options to only allow a certain set of hosts this
makes it easy for an attacker to manipulate an application. DBGp
instead has the facility for &lt;a href="http://xdebug/docs-dbgp.php#just-in-time-debugging-and-debugger-proxies"&gt;Proxy
Servers&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to have multiple people debugging
applications on the same development server.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Transporting Variables
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE protocol uses serialized data to transfer variables from the
debugging engine to the IDE. (It does not define what kind of
serialization is used, so I have to assume it's the same as the output
of PHP's serialize() call). DBGp uses an XML format.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course serialized PHP data uses less data and an XML format to
describe a variable takes more space. But PHP's serialized data is a
format that is only specific for PHP and will not match correctly to
other languages. DBGp's XML format is language agnostic and allows the
definition of a typemap to see which language's native type maps to a
DBGp data type.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE protocol allows you to select the maximum depth of variable
contents to return when you request a variable, DBGp has something
similar by means of setting options for a debugging connection. Besides
a maximum depth DBGp also provides functionality for limiting the amount
of elements that is returned in one array, and how much of the content
of a variable is returned. This was added so that one array with 10.000
elements containing a 500 byte string can not clog down the connection
between debugging engine and IDE.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Breakpoint Support
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE protocol only supports either conditional breakpoints with a
condition, or static breakpoints on a file/line number combination. The
DBGp protocol supports breakpoints on exceptions, function entry,
function return and watches as well. The DBGp protocol also facilitates
that certain breakpoints should only be used when they're reached after
or before a certain hit-count.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Output Capturing
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The PHP IDE debugger protocol only supports "PHP Script
Output", DBGp supports both stdout and stderr capturing in two
types of streams.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Conclusion
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The proposed protocol for the PHP IDE seems to be less powerful than the
DBGp protocol. I wonder then also whether people on the Zend team
actually had a look at the DBGp protocol. There were plenty of
opportunies where we suggest that there is some discussion about the
protocol but there was never any answer to this. In case you're
interested in the DBGp protocol and want to discuss things with it, or
if you want some help by adapting DBGp to use in an IDE that you are
developing feel free to contact us at the &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org/support.php"&gt;Xdebug general mailinglist&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>Parsing Mail with PHP</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/parsing_mail_with_php.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
Many PHP applications require to parse e-mail messages. For example bug
systems and ticket systems that want to allow input by e-mail. For
sending e-mail there are already decent implementations, &lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/1.0.1/(file)/introduction_Mail.html"&gt;ones&lt;/a&gt;
that even allow sending multi-part and mixed text/html messages with
attachments and so on.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Parsing e-mail is a whole different story, and definitely not an easy
task. As &lt;a href="http://ez.no"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; see this task as something
important we decided to add e-mail parsing functionality to the Mail
&lt;a href="http://ez.no/products/ez_components"&gt;component&lt;/a&gt;. We
just released an alpha release of this component as &lt;a href="http://pear.php.net"&gt;PEAR package&lt;/a&gt; which you should be able
to install with (not sure if you have to add the components channel
first, for information on how to do that see the "PEAR
Installer" section in &lt;a href="http://ez.no/community/articles/an_introduction_to_ez_components"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
article.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pear install components.ez.no/mail-beta

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Mail parsing part of the component can currently use a POP3 server
or a file to parse e-mail messages from. A small example to parse
e-mail from a POP 3 server looks like (if you use the PEAR installer to
install the component):
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php
require_once &amp;quot;ezc/Base/base.php&amp;quot;;
function __autoload( $className )
{
    ezcBase::autoload( $className );
}
$pop3 = new ezcMailPop3Transport( &amp;quot;pop3.example.com&amp;quot; );
$pop3-&amp;gt;authenticate( &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;password&amp;quot; );
$set = $pop3-&amp;gt;fetchAll();
$parser = new ezcMailParser();
$mails = $parser-&amp;gt;parseMail( $set );
foreach ( $mails as $mail )
{
    echo &amp;quot;From: {$mail-&amp;gt;from-&amp;gt;email}\n&amp;quot;;
    echo &amp;quot;To: &amp;quot;;
    foreach ( $mail-&amp;gt;to as $to ) {
        echo &amp;quot;{$to-&amp;gt;name} ({$to-&amp;gt;email}) &amp;quot;;
    }
    echo &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;;
    echo &amp;quot;Subject: {$mail-&amp;gt;subject}\n&amp;quot;;
    switch ( get_class( $mail-&amp;gt;body ) )
    {
        case 'ezcMailText':
            echo &amp;quot;Text part, &amp;quot;.
                &amp;quot;type={$mail-&amp;gt;body-&amp;gt;subType}\n--\n&amp;quot;;
            echo $mail-&amp;gt;body-&amp;gt;text;
            echo &amp;quot;\n--\n&amp;quot;;
            break;
        case 'ezcMailMultipartMixed':
            echo &amp;quot;Multipart mail\n&amp;quot;;
            break;
    }
    echo &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;;
}
?&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The $mail variable now holds an array of &lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/latest/(file)/Mail/ezcMail.html"&gt;ezcMail&lt;/a&gt;
objects. For more information on how to access the information in the
mail classes, please refer to the &lt;a href="http://ez.no/doc/components/view/latest/(file)/classtrees_Mail.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
Currently not all the ezcMailPart decendents document the available
properties yet, but this will ofcourse be addressed before the first
beta.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the near future we want to expand the component with an IMAP
transport, more authentication mechanisms and add methods that allow
you to "reply" to a parsed e-mail message or
"forward" one. Those methods then set the correct headers in
the e-mail object, including the correct handling of
"References" and "In-Reply-To" headers.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/holmenkollen1.png' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Every year there is a ski jumping event in Oslo, at the Holmenkollen
venue. As I'm turning more and more Norwegian now (already been here
for almost two years now) I could not let this slip. So together with
some folks we drove to Oslo and walked up the hill to the venue. It's
pretty impressive to see how high this hill they jump off actually is.
Much more impressive then on TV.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Normally Holmenkollen is always very foggy, but this year there was
excellent weather: "warm" and sunny. We were a bit early so
had to wait a bit but atleast there were some performances to get the
audience going. Amazingly that seemed to work better than I expected.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/holmenkollen2.png' align='left' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were 50 participants and they started in the order they were
ranked in &lt;a href="http://www.fis-ski.com"&gt;FIS&lt;/a&gt;' World
Championship. After the first round the best 30 continue to the second
heat where the best one from the first heat is the last man to jump.
Adam Malysz &lt;a href="http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/604/610.html?sector=JP&amp;raceid=1987"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt;
which didn't please the Norwegians too much (best Norwegian was 10th).
There were a lot of Poles at the event though, and they were ofcourse
quite happy.
		&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Singapore, Bangkok and Bintan</title>
  <link>http://derickrethans.nl/singapore_bangkok_and_bintan.php</link>
  <content:encoded>
&lt;p&gt;
In the last week of November and the first week of December I had my
holiday, which I choose to spend in South East Asia. &lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6427.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt; The first stop
was Singapore, where I have &lt;a href="http://bijfemme.nl"&gt;some
family&lt;/a&gt;. That made it an exellent point to start my trip. The
flight to Singapore is quite long from where I'm living and the 7 hour
time difference is not very nice either. The moment I stepped out of
the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;
and into the taxi the rain started pouring down, topped off with a nice
loud lightning strike - that was an excellent start.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Singapore is a very &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"&gt;modern and western&lt;/a&gt;
city, albeit it has a lot of eastern influences. &lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6458.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt; Not only from
the Chinese and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_people"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt;, but also
from Tamils. Therefore in Singapore most signs are in 4 languages
(English, which is still the primairy language, Mandarin Chinese, Tamil
and Malay). The influences from the other cultures are mostly visible in
dedicated areas. There is Little India and of course China Town.
Interestingly enough, the largest hindoe temple (to the right) is in
China Town :).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6523.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Stamford_Raffles"&gt;Stamford
Raffles&lt;/a&gt; reached Singapore in the early 1800s he did not find a
large bustling city that is now Singpare, but instead he found a lot of
rain forest. There is still some of it left, in the northern part of the
country, in a nature reserve called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Nature_Reserve"&gt;Bukit
Timah&lt;/a&gt; where monkeys still roam freely (although they also pester
you near the entrance of the park).
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6576.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt; From Singapore we made a
6 day trip to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, which
official name in Thai is "กรุงเทพมหานคร
อมรรัตนโกสินทร์
มหินทรายุธยามหาดิลก

is a whole different world compared to Singapore. Where Singapore is
clean and modern, Bangkok is large and polluted and has a horrible
traffic problem. The main attraction (atleast for me) is all the
different temples (wat in Thai). As I like photography, all those
temples are a nice subject to take shots of. At your left you find the
46 meter long reclining buddha at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Pho"&gt;Wat Pho&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6616.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt;
Above is one of the decorations around the building housing the emerald
buddha at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Kaew"&gt;Wat
Phra Kaew&lt;/a&gt;. This temple lies on the Grand Palace premises, which
houses a lot of other templates and the some buildings used for
royalty. &lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6689.jpg' align='left' alt=''/&gt; We visited the day before
the King's birthday which unfortunately meant that some of the buildings
were closed. Our hotel was close to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaosan_Road"&gt;Khaosan Road&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a very vibrant area with lots of food stands and shops that
sell fake stuff :). One temple that has quite a different style
compared to the others is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Arun"&gt;Wat Arun&lt;/a&gt; which you
see here on the left. It's in Khmer style and covered with porcelain.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After 6 days we left Bangkok and prepared for our next trip. The next
trip went to Bintan, an Indonesian island about an hour by ferry from
Singapore. As Dutchie I needed to get a visa for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; so we had
to spend some annoying time at the Indonesian embassy in Singapore. We
managed to retrieve our passport with the visa just in time before
going to Thailand so we were all set to go.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6766.jpg' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bintan"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt; is a small
island and mostly leased by Singapore to put resorts on. We did not go
to the North Western resort area but instead we went to Trikora Beach
on the east side. We stayed at the &lt;a href="http://www.lobo.kinemotion.de/"&gt;Shady Shack&lt;/a&gt; which is
definitely not a luxurious place. It did have running water (from a
large tank) and electricity but that was about it. The main attraction
was the nice beach on which our shacks were located. We were the only
tourists there and it was very nice and quiet to relax on for a whole
day. &lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/asia2005/dsc_6874.jpg' align='right' alt=''/&gt; On the second day of our
stay we walked to a nearby fishing village that was built on poles in
the ocean. During the night the villagers go out fishing with their
kelang (houses on floats) and during they day they would sell their
fish in the village. Bintan gave me a small tan and I relaxed quite
nicely. In the afternoon of the second day we went back to Singapore
where I concluded my holiday.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/eiffel.png' align='left' alt=''/&gt; Last
weekend we had a PHP developers meeting in Paris to discuss PHP 6.
(More about that later). Ofcourse when you're in Paris you need to see
some of the sights. Together with &lt;a href="http://marcus-boerger.de"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gravitonic.com"&gt;Andrei&lt;/a&gt; and Jani we toured the famous
landmarks in Paris. On the left you can see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower"&gt;the Eiffel Tour&lt;/a&gt;
and below the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe"&gt;Arc de
Triomphe&lt;/a&gt;.
		&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Frankfurt Zoo</title>

&lt;p&gt;
During the conference in &lt;a href="http://derickrethans.nl/frankfurt_conference.php"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; I visited the local
Zoo with &lt;a href="http://ilia.ws"&gt;Ilia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sebastian-bergmann.de"&gt;Sebastian&lt;/a&gt; to take some
pictures.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/lion.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately most of the animals were inside, and it's quite hard to
take pictures through think glass. But atleast you can get really close
up pictures without your head getting torn off.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/reptile.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This shows really well what an aperture of 1.2 does - you can see that
only a very small amount is in the focus area here.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src='http://derickrethans.nl/images/content/leopard.png' align='' alt=''/&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Outside we found two leopards, one was constantly moving, but this one
was quietly laying and watching around.
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The rest of the pictures from the Zoo are in my &lt;a href="http://photos.derickrethans.nl/animals"&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;.
