The SignalSlot component implements a mechanism for inter and intra object
communication through the use of signals and slots. Signals are emitted through
instances of the ezcSignalCollection class and connected to as many functions as you
like. The SignalSlot component supports parametered signals and prioritized connections
as well as static signal connections.
