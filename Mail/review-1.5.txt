ezcMailComposerOptions
======================

- Cast to bool is not necessary in Mail/src/options/composer_options.php +75.

=================

- Why is there only a failure case tested? I don't see (at a first glance)
  that the sorting is really tested at all. If I'm wrong with that: Please add
  a comment to the test. Thanks!
