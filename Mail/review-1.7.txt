=================

[ ] The function parseHeader() should be refactored. The new code has in 
    the if() and elseif() case duplicated code that can easily be extracted
    into a new private method.

[ ] The test in trunk/Mail/tests/composer_test.php should removed the
    added check for "charset=binary" as that is a bug in PHP (line 647ish)

[ ] From reading the code, I don't think that it is possible to use
    headers with the same name while creating mail as well. This needs to
    be supported so that mails can be forwarded with all current headers
    in tact. We'd need to add tests for both generation and forwarding/replying
    here.
