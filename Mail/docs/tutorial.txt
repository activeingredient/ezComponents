eZ components - Mail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. contents:: Table of Contents


Introduction
============

The mail component provides functionality to both send, retrieve and parse
mail messages. 
use the ezcMailComposer class. This class allows you to send HTML mail with
images, attachments and an optional text part.
If you require more advanced email messages you can build the complete message
yourself using the ezcMailPart derived classes.


Class overview
==============

This section gives you an overview of the main classes of in the Mail
component.

ezcMailComposer
   The mail composer is a convenience class that allows you to send plain or
   HTML messages with attachments without the need to construct the parts of
   the message yourself. Most users want to use this class.

ezcMail
   If ezcMailComposer does not have the functionality you require you can use
   the ezcMail class to build MIME structured mail from scratch. This requires 
   basic knowledge about how a mail is structured.

ezcMailAddress
  This small class represents a mail address with an optional name. It is used
  by both ezcMailComposer and ezcMail to set recipient addresses.

ezcMailParser
  This class parses mail messages from text into ezcMail structures. You can
  use it together with the mail retrieval transport classes.


Usage
=====

Transport protocols
-------------------

The mail component provides transport protocols both for sending and retrieving
mail.
For sending mail we support:

- SMTP through the class ezcMailSmtpTransport
- MTA through the class ezcMailMtaTransport

ezcMailSmtpTransport makes it possible to send mail over the SMTP
protocol. If you prefer using a local mail agent you can use
ezcMailMtaTransport which wraps over the PHP mail function..

For mail retrieval we currently support:

- POP3 through the class ezcMailPop3Transport
- IMAP through the class ezcMailImapTransport

Other transports:

- MBOX transport to handle Unix mailbox formats
- File transport to handle emails stored in files
- Variable transport to handle emails stored in memory

Send a mail with the composer
-----------------------------

Sending a mail using the composer is very straightforward. This small example
displays how to send a normal text message.

.. include:: tutorial_example_01.php
   :literal:

Send a mail with HTML, inline images and attachments
----------------------------------------------------

An example with HTML text, images and attachments can be found in the
ezcMailComposer class description.

Building a mail from scratch
-----------------------------

The class structure of the mail component follows that of the mail MIME. This
means that you can build advanced MIME messages part by part.

The first example displays how to build a similar message to the one above.

.. include:: tutorial_example_02.php
   :literal:

As you can see there is not much difference compared to the composer version. 
In the next example we will add an attachment to our manually built mail:

.. include:: tutorial_example_03.php
   :literal:

The file 'myfile.jpg' must of course exist in order for this example to work.

Extending the mail component
----------------------------

Even though the mail component supports a lot it does not support
everything. There is no reason to dispair however, since it is very simple to
extend. The following example shows how you can insert mail digests as
attachments to your mail.

The mail system already supports sending attachments through the
ezcMailMultipartMixed type. Unfortunately directly inserting an ezcMail object
as a part does not work. This is because mail digests are a special case: they
require two extra headers that are separated by the normal headers in the
e-mail.

To make it work we will create the class RFC822Digest that adds these headers:

.. include:: tutorial_example_04.php
   :literal:

Our new class extends the ezcMailPart class. This is required for all parts of
a mail. ezcMailPart provides two important methods that we can override:
ezcMailPart::generateHeaders() and ezcMailPart::generateBody(). These two
methods are called in succession by the parent part and should return the
headers and the body text of the part.
We don't need to override generateHeaders() since we can simply set the headers
we want directly on the object. We do need to override generateBody() however,
since we want to include the full text of the mail digest.

The new class can be used directly when building an email. The example assumes
that a valid ezcMail object is available in the $digest variable.

.. include:: tutorial_example_05.php
   :literal:

Character encoding
------------------

Most of the world does not speak and write US ascii and require more advanced
character encoding to display their mail correctly.

The following example shows how to send a mail entirely encoded with
iso-8859-1:

.. include:: tutorial_example_06.php
   :literal:

You can of course choose and combine any available character set. Make sure
that the input text is in the encoding specified or you may get unexpected
results.

Mail retrieval and parsing
--------------------------

Many applications have a need to interact with an email address. The mail
component makes this easy through the class ezcMailParser and the mail
retrieval transport classes. Mail is fetched, parsed and returned to you in the
same structure that is used to send mail.

The mail components currently allows you to fetch and parse mail messages from
POP3, mbox files, single mail files and from variables. The parser fully
supports mail in all character sets, multipart mail (attachments), HTML mail, HTML mail with
images and digest messages.

The following example shows how to fetch all messages from a POP3 account and
parse them for usage.

.. include:: tutorial_example_07.php
   :literal:

The parser returns an array of ezcMail messages with parts organized as the
MIME structure of the mail.

If the mail contains attachments they will be saved to disk in temporary
files. If you want to keep the files they must be moved to a temporary place as
shown in the next example.

.. include:: tutorial_example_08.php
   :literal:

For a more elaborate example please see the display_example_.

Troubleshooting
===============

Qmail MTA
---------

Qmail insists it should only have "\n" linebreaks and will send garbled messages
with the default "\\r\\n" setting. Use ezcMailTools::setLineBreak( "\\n" ) before 
sending mail to fix this issue.
