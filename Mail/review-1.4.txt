[ ] Options should always be done through an options class, and no longer
    through arrays like is shown in trunk/Mail/docs/tutorial/tutorial_smtp_auth.php.
	See: http://ez.no/ezcomponents/contributing/coding_standards#id45
	As in this case there are options before, the functionality should stay,
	but the array() way of passing objects should not be documented.

[ ] The same in ezcMailImapSet but as that did not have options before, the
    array way should not be supported at all.

[ ] The "James Bond" header looks broken to me in the tutorial.

[ ] Shouldn't the charset for headers default to "Utf-8" instead of "us-ascii"?
    I am not sure what we do in other cases, it of course has to be consistent.

[ ] Isn't the "$charset = $this->getHeaderCharset" to
	"$value = substr( $value, 7 ); // "dummy: " + 1" bit copied from somewhere?
	If so, we should make this a new (private) method somewhere.

[ ] In ezcMailImapTransport, why did you change many properties to protected
    (from private)?

[ ] I see some strange things with ezcMailTransportMta vs ezcMailMtaTransport 
    in the trunk/Mail/src/transports/mta/mta_transport.php file... are you 
	sure you didn't swap something? Or was it fucked up before? :)

[ ] The same thing seems to be going on with ezcMailTransportSmtp vs
    ezcMailSmtpTransport.
