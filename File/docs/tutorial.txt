eZ Components - File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

The File component currently contains one class, providing a few handy
file system operations that are missing from PHP.

Class overview
==============

ezcFile is the only class in this component. It provides two static methods:
ezcFile::findRecursive() and ezcFile::removeRecursive().


Usage
=====

Finding files recursively
-------------------------

This example shows how to use the ezcFile::findRecursive() method:

.. include:: tutorial_example_01.php
   :literal:

The code in this example searches for files in the ``/dat/dev/ezcomponents``
directory. It will only include files that match *all* patterns in the
$includeFilters array (the second parameter). Files that match *any* of the
patterns in the $excludeFilters array (the third parameter) will not be returned.

In other words, the code above searches for files in the ``dat/dev/ezcomponents``
directory, which are in the ``src/`` directory and end with ``_autoload.php``,
except for files that are in the ``/autoload/`` directory.

Removing directories recursively
--------------------------------

This example shows how to use the ezcFile::removeRecursive() method:

.. include:: tutorial_example_02.php
   :literal:

This code simply removes the directory ``/dat/dev/ezcomponents/trash`` and all
of its files and sub-directories.

**Warning: Use this function with care, as it has the potential to erase
everything that the current user has access to.**
