eZ components - File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

The File components currently contains one class that provides a few often used
filesystem operations that are missing from PHP.

Class overview
==============

This section gives you an overview on all classes, that are intended to be
used directly.

ezcFile
  The only class in this component. It only provides two static methods:
  ezcFile::findRecursive() and ezcFile::removeRecursive().


Usage
=====

Finding Files Recursively
-------------------------

This example shows how to use the ezcFile::findRecursive() method:

.. include:: tutorial_example_01.php
   :literal:

The code in this example searched for files in the ``/dat/dev/ezcomponents``
directory. It will only include files that match *all* patterns in the array
that you passed as the $includeFilters parameter. Files that match *any* of the
patterns in the array that you pass to $excludeFilters will not be returned
either.

In other words the code above searches for files in the ``dat/dev/ezcomponents``
directory, that are in the ``src/`` directory and end with ``_autoload.php``.
Except files that are in the ``/autoload/`` directory.

Removing Directories Recursively
--------------------------------

This example shows how to use the ezcFile::removeRecursive() method:

.. include:: tutorial_example_02.php
   :literal:

This code simply removes the directory ``/dat/dev/ezcomponents/trash`` and all
the files and directories in that directory.

**Warning: Use this function with care, as it has the potential to erase
everything that the current user has access to.**
