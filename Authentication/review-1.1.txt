[ ] In the tutorial the example under "Improving authentication performance
	when using the session" should have <?php tags around it in order to
	highlight it properly in the docs. This should preferable also be done
	in <code> examples in the code API docs as well.

[ ] trunk/Authentication/src/filters/ldap/ldap_filter.php method fetchData()
    has no @return documented, but only a @param - run Toby's check script?

[ ] trunk/Authentication/src/filters/openid/openid_filter.php and
    trunk/Authentication/tests/filters/openid/data/openid_wrapper.php have
    whitespace issues (tabs instead of spaces)

[ ] In trunk/Authentication/src/filters/openid/openid_filter.php, checkImmediate()
    there is the following block:

       fputs( $connection, implode( "\r\n", $headers ) . "\r\n\r\n" );

       $src = '';
       while ( !feof( $connection ) )
       {
           $src .= fgets( $connection, 1024 );
       }
       fclose( $connection );

	The while..fclose() part can more efficiently be done with
	stream_get_contents() I think.

[ ] ezcAuthenticationTypekeyFilter::registerFetchData() is an empty method. If
    that's correct, add a comment please.

[ ] Add documentation to parseQueryString() that it is related to ezcUrl (The
    same code) - You might want to add that in Url as well.
