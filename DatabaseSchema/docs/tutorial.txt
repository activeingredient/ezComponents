.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

The File components currently contains one class that provides a few often used
filesystem operations that are missing from PHP.

Class overview
==============

This section gives you an overview on all classes, that are intended to be
used directly.

ezcDbSchema
  Contains the structure of a database. A ezcDbSchema object can be created out
  of files containing a description, or directly from the database. A
  ezcDbSchema can also be written to a file in different formats and converted
  to SQL DDL. It is also possible to create a database structure directly from
  an ezcDbSchema object.

ezcDbSchemaComparator
  This class provide an interface for comparing two database schema definitions
  that are stored in the ezcDbSchema class.

ezcDbSchemaDiff
  The ezcDbSchemaHandlerManager::compareSchemas() method returns an object of
  this class. The object can be converted to SQL DDL, stored in a file or can
  be directly applied to a database.

ezcDbSchemaHandlerManager
  This class can be used to register different handlers for reading and writing
  ezcDbSchema and ezcDbSchemaDiff objects. Its functions to create a reader or
  writer are used by the ezcDbSchema and ezcDbSchemaDiff classes to do the real
  work.

ezcDbSchemaValidator
  Provides one method that allows you to validate a ezcDbSchema class. It
  checks whether indexes are on existing columns and if the types are used are
  correct. It provides an easy API so that other validation checks can be
  easily added.
