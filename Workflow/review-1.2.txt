[/] ezcWorkflowDefinitionStorageXml mentions a @todo: DTD for the XML file.

      While I learned writing DTDs at University a couple of years ago,
      I have never actually written one. In any case, I think we should
      provide an XML Schema (or RelaxNG) specification instead. Again,
      I have no practical experience in writing either of these.

[ ] Listeners or plugins are not mentioned in the tutorial.

      Will do.

[ ] The class docs for ezcWorkflowExecutionListenerPlugin and
    ezcWorkflowExecutionVisualizerPlugin need an example on how they can be used.

      Will do.

[X] Why is ezcWorkflowExecution::endThread marked with @ignore? As well as some
    other methods in this class?

      These methods are marked with @ignore as they are never to be called
      by the developer that uses the component(s). They are declared public
      because other classes of the component(s) need access to them.

[/] There is only 95.54% code coverage when running just the Workflow tests.
    Especially the listener doesn't seem to have any direct tests.

      Some parts of the base Workflow component can only be tested when the
      functionality of the WorkflowDatabaseTiein in present/used. We are
      already mocking a lot of functionality in the Workflow component's
      tests using the ezcWorkflowTestExecution class. I am not sure if
      mocking even more functionality makes sense. I will look into the
      particular example of the listener functionality.
