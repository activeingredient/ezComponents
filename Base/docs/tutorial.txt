eZ components - Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Introduction
============

The Base component provides the basic functionality that the components need to
function properly. As every other component depends on the Base package for
e.g. autoloading, the Base component needs to be loaded specifically. 

Besides the autoload functionality the Base component also contains a number of
generic Exception classes that all inherit from the ezcBaseException class.


Installation
============

The installation and configuration of the eZ components environment is
described in a separate article. Please refer to the `Components Introduction`_
for instructions on installation and configuration of the eZ components library
and the Base component.
