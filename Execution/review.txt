Review Raymond 9.12.2005
========================

General:
[done] - Use a dot when a sentence ends (in doc). 

ezcExecution::exceptionCallbackHandler:
[done] - Maybe an extra note that this method shouldn't be called directly. 

ezcExecutionBasicErrorHandler::onError: 
[done] - Don't think that the error message is useful. Either:
[done]   - Add an description that the handlers should be extended.
[done]   - The message can be used in an "Enterprise" environment ;-).
